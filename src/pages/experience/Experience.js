						"Breast cancer is a common, potentially fatal condition with high morbidity and mortality. Its malignancy ranks second as a cause of cancer death in women. Mammogram is an important tool to detect mass and diagnosis breast cancer. We are developing a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for breast cancer using mammogram based on convolution neural networks (CNN) to assistant radiologists in achieving better performance during diagnosis. Due to the variable image quality and shapes typically present on some mammograms, it is difficult to observe the significant characteristics of cancer such as microcalcification and mass, and challenging to interpret the features and make a diagnosis on these cases. The purpose of this study is to develop a new fully automatic feature extraction and classification method in breast cancer CAD systems.",

						"Cloud computing is typically defined as a type of computing that relies on sharing of computing resources rather than having local servers. Cloud computing has brought new changes and opportunities to IT industry. It is a new emerging technology, the years of research in virtualization, distributed and utility computing, and more recently networking, web and software services created base for the term 'Cloud' in Cloud Computing. It offers a service oriented architecture, reduced information technology overhead for the end-user, greater for flexibility, reduced total cost of ownership, on-demand services and many other things. The railway department will use the cloud computing to achieve sharing of railway information resources and to improve the capacity of information processing. The recent move; Indian Railways have given few contracts to IT companies to enhance train services by installing Wi-Fi in selected train. The Indian railway is the world’s fourth largest railway network which carries near about 30 million passengers daily and near about 2.8 million tons of freight daily [12]. But in spite of that, the railways usually under goesloss and main reason behind this is that a large number of passengers every day travelled without ticket which results in overloading of compartments and in turn creating problem for reserved train ticket holders. Thus, by implementing cloud computing for Indian railways we can develop a system which can improve its facilities. The organization of this paper is like section I gives introductory details, section II and III discuss details about why to use cloud computing? and different cloud service models, section IV and V throws light on cloud deployment models and role of IT in railway respectively, in section VI improvement in railway using cloud computing, in section VII techniques used in I-RS, in section VIII advantages and in section IX challenges of proposed system are discussed. In section X concluding remarks and at the lastreferences are mentioned",

Today the mobile phone is not only a full communication platform with email, instant messaging, video calls, and a social media interface, it also offers functional applications like navigation, e-commerce. In short, the Smartphone has become the most successful “functionality aggregator”. Mobile payment, also referred to as mobile money, mobile money transfer, and mobile wallet, generally it is refer to payment services operated from or via a mobile device [1]. In this paper, we will discuss about mobile payment technologies their characteristics which are required to be used by mobile payment systems, common-uncommon things among them and advancement in the system. We will also look a complete comparison between the commonly used technologies like: Bluetooth, Infrared data association (IrDA), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communications (NFC) according to the most common factors which affect the quality of mobile payment systems presented. In this paper evaluations of the advantages and issues involved with using these technologies are also presented.",

						"This paper presents advancement in public transport services, like use of Hi-Tech components and software which may lead this transportation system to be more stable and easier to operate. In this paper, we will introduce a framework which will help passengers and other users to track exact location of bus and count number of passengers. Today major problem of public transportation is overloading of buses which leads to accidents and creates life risk to other vehicles. In this paper, we will introduce some devices which can keep count of passengers travelling in buses. We will also introduce cloud computing which in turn will help government as well as user to easily operate and keep track of bus services. So, Let us first see what is cloud? - as we know that cloud computing can be used for deploying groups of remote servers and software’s networked that allows centralized data storage and online access to computer services or resources[10] services such as shared resources, platforms, software and data, as per the interest of end-users [10]. They are located in distributed datacenters over a network such as internet. In this paper, we will introduce a new cloud computing model called Hi-tech Cloud computing model for public transportation and it is also proposed to improve transport outcomes like to track the location, count passengers. Therefore, by using this proposed cloud services public transportation system will lead to new peak. The organization of this paper is viz. in section [A] introductory details, in section [B] role of Information Technology in Public Transportation system, in section [C] proposed improvements in it, in section [D] working methodology for proposed advancements in the same is described. The section [E] represents concluding remarks and in section [F] references used in this paper are listed.",

						"The government authority, banking industry and regular citizens all experience a high overhead in using cash and credit/debit cards. E-cash and Mobile payment in particular is a feasible alternative to physical cash, since it will experience much lower overhead and offers more convenience. The concept of Mobile Payment is also known as Mobile Money and Mobile Wallet. Here, in all such systems customer will be paying for a wide range of goods and services using mobile phone. In today's world, mobile device is the most popularly used system for Mobile Payment. Wireless and proximity technology provides a new way for implementation and working of mobile payment systems. In this aspect, the capacity and power of using short-range wireless technologies such as Bluetooth is extensive. Bluetooth is an open wireless and widely available protocol for transmitting and receiving data over short distances between two mobile phones. In our proposed system Bluetooth is used as a connection medium between two devices. In this paper, implementation of new concept of mobile payment system using Bluetooth is presented.",

Not only does he have significant skills and training, he brings a curiosity, dedication to self-instruction, and ease with collaboration that is every bit as valuable, if not more than, his raw skills, extensive training, and meaningful accomplishments. He made me better at my job when I worked with him. He made my colleagues better. He made our organization function better. He left work with us which represents a first in my company's 125+ year history.

Mr. Patel was a distinct pleasure to have as a colleague. I quickly learned that when he asked me for something he had already done extensive research into the problem on his own, I wouldn't be able to add to what he knew with a simple google search or by reading the relevant reference material. When I gave him advice, he took it. I can't tell you how rare that is. I never had to tell him something twice. Often after I did point him towards a solution he would circle back to me to explain what he found and offer more information he thought might help me that he came across in the process.

When he moved on from our organization I was ambivalent. On the one hand, I was thrilled to see him get an opportunity he richly deserves, on the other I genuinely grieved the loss. Mr. Patel is a role model. I'm happy to know him. </blockquote>

												<blockquote className='textcs'>I have had the opportunity to work with Rushab for about 2 years when he was a data scientist at Jvion. In addition to possessing thorough skills and knowledge of AI and ML techniques and applying them to the models he built, he also thinks about the operational side of these models in supporting business in tracking daily and periodic performance variability of the models.
In addition to the skills required to be a good data scientist, he is a solid team player and possesses a great attitude towards work which is often visible in times of uncertainty i.e aggressive timelines, changing requirements, not so clean input data etc.
He would be a great asset to any team.</blockquote>

													<blockquote className='textcs'>Rushabh joined me as a Research Assistant in January’16. I supervised him for project, “A Novel Computer Aided Diagnosis System for Breast Cancer Based on Reinforcement Sample Learning Strategy for Convolution Neural Network”, “Big Data Analytics on SIU hospital data” and “Edge detection using convolution neural network”. Rushabh presented outstanding commitment to his studies, and finished his degree within the top 1% of his class. He is a quite remarkable student with a strong research interest. Among his peers, he stood out by always being up-to-date with currently topical discussions even within niches of this research. The quality of his research work on project was compelling, and he managed to find beautifully simple solutions to very challenging problems. With his multicultural background and fluent proficiency of English, he could approach many scientific questions from different angles.
It was a pleasure working with Rushabh for the past 1 year. Rushabh is a person with a strong analytical approach. He sees and can address everything from the big picture to the details. Rushabh is creative, energetic, solutions oriented and highly motivated with great communication skills. I strongly recommend him for any professional or research oriented job.

													<blockquote className='textcs'>I met Rushabh in the spring of 2016 while he was a master's student in computer science at UIS. At the time, two colleagues and I were looking for a research assistant to work with us on a university-funded research project. Rushabh applied for the position. None of us knew him because he came from another department but we were impressed not only with his technical knowledge and skills, which surpassed the other applicants', but also with his communication abilities, pleasant personality and self-confidence. He got the job. My 3-month collaboration with Rushabh during the summer of 2016 confirmed my initial impressions. Rushabh worked with us on data collection and coding for a meta-analytic study of supply chain integration. He parsed through hundreds of papers, identified the relevant papers and collected from them the effect sizes to include in our dataset. As a computer science major, Rushabh did not initially know much about supply chain management. But he learned very quickly. It was a pleasure to work with him. He understood what needed to be done, worked very hard, and completed his part of the project in the limited time that we had. It is an honor to recommend him.</blockquote>

													<blockquote className='textcs'>I had Rushabh in my CSC570 Big Data Analytics class in FALL 2016 and he was, without doubt, at the top 1% of class. Rushabh is very professional, smart, reliable, dedicated, and a creative thinker. The solutions he submitted for many of the class projects exceeded my expectations and demonstrated his ability to learn and think critically. He even did all the optional and challenge projects in the course. As final project for Big Data Analytics class, Rushabh built an analyzed the ACM citation graph with Spark and Hadoop. I was very impressed with Rushabh’s performance in class and I am currently collaborating with him on a research project I am conducting with SIU School of Medicine on analyzing pediatric big data to discover pediatric population that are more at risk for certain diseases in Southern Illinois Region. Rushabh will also assisted me on a workshop on Twitter Graph Analysis we presented in March 2017 at Cyber Defense and Disaster Recovery Conference at UIS. Rushabh is also modest about his abilities and is a very pleasant person to work and interact with. Rushabh is very reliable and persistent. I have no doubt that Rushabh will be a great addition to any company who is willing to give him a chance as an international student.</blockquote>
